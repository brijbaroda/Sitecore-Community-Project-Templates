##What are Sitecore Community Project Templates?

Sitecore Community Project Templates, are set of projects with predefined nuget packages and assembly references. The main highlight of the Module are the Starter Kits that we have built

##Why use Sitecore Community Project Templates?

All passionate developers have one thing in common, learning a new thing and then doing a small demo regarding it to understand its core concept. -- isn't it? <br/> 
And, while doing so, we create a Sitecore solution and a Visual Studio project solution. Now, for our help, Alen Pelin has already created SIM, which helps in setting up a Sitecore solution very quick. But still, we spend a lot of time in setting up the visual studio solution. We thought, why not create a set of project templates (for individual projects) and starter kits (a project solution containing multiple projects) so that the time to setup things is set to minimum and a developer only concentrates on one thing -- The POC of his/her learning! <br/>

With this noble cause, started a journey of formulating the projects and what you see is a very basic first cut of the project templates. We have a future plan of upgrading these and making it very useful not just for POC stuff, but even for live projects. We dream to make it so worth of use, that for every Web project / Project solution that any Architect/Lead Developer of a project makes, he/she uses Sitecore Community Project Templates! <br/>

Well, if you wish to contribute to this Sitecore Module, then you need to take the following steps: <br/>
1. Fork the Development Branch of the Module on Github. <br/>
2. Add the code that you wish to.<br/>
3. Create a Pull request, so that we can understand that you have added some functionality.<br/>
4. You also need to update the readme and tell us why you added it and which files were updated.<br/>
5. We will test the code on our side and will include it in the main dev branch and then the master branch if we don't find anything malicious. Also, its not like if you send a code we will add it, if it doesn't go with the concept or if it contains some malicious code, we might reject the code too. So sorry if that happens with you.
